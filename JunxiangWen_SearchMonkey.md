## Project Relevance
	GitHub: for the team work, everyone can be assigned for different task, and also they can look at other branchs eayily to improvement or share their idea
	Object Oriented Design: this project is only using java. Java can hardly do without Object Oriented Design. this is an importeant goal for this course.
	Test Driven Development: For the big project, TDD is very using to help the project check part of project that run succeedfully such as a method or a class.
	Graphic User Interface: Although Java Swing is not popular today. But learning a GUI is still useful because most GUI engine is similar. SearchMonkey is using java swing for the panel. 
	
## Conceptual Design
	Using the search engine and basic panel from the SearchMonkey for the proposal.
	My proposal is improvement Search Monkey that is  similar to Google Shoping, but using different implementation approach.
	User can search the item in the Monkey Shoping App, then it will search for item price, image and relevant information from
	some major sites using powerful regular expression and MySQL. After sorting, user can scan offered information from the software.
